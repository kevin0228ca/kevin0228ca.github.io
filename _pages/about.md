I am a Senior HCI researcher at Huawei Canada, where I research, design, and build interactive techniques and intellectual properties for emerging technology and products.
Before Huawei, I was building markerless motion capture solutions using deep learning, and also digital human embodiment in VR.
I obtained my PhD at Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.
My advisors were [Prof. Masahiko Inami](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/research/people/staff-inami_masahiko.html) and [Prof. Kouta Minamizawa](https://www.kmd.keio.ac.jp/faculty/kouta-minamizawa).
My research in HCI is at the intersection of VR/AR and emerging products (mobiles/wearables/smart vehicles/IoT).
Please see my [research page](https://kevinfan.com/research/) for some examples of my work.
