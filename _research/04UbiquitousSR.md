We propose an immersive Substitutional Reality (SR) system that enables users to experience alternate realities as they walk around in the live reality’s environment by substituting or blending in pre-recorded realities. SR is fundamentally a concept of presenting realities that are of a different time than the live reality to the users through seamless transitions so the users feel as one coherent experience. Suzuki et al. construct the alternate realities from pre-recorded panoramic video images of the past and aim to study humans’ brain behavior when they perceive the past reality as happening before their eyes and interact in their SR system. We install our system in the home environment as to provide an immersive way for people to record and re-experience their treasured memories. To achieve seamless transition, we integrate sensors in the furniture that can sense the users’ interactions so the transition can be implicitly triggered as users subjectively interact with the furniture. As the sensor interfaces are integrated invisibly with the furniture and the experience occurs naturally when interacted, we consider this to be a kind of ubiquitous experience.
